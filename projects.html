												<h3 class="major">Warp Drive</h3>
												<p>The Theory behind Faster than Light travel in Sci-Fi novels derived from Einstien's General Relativity. The model above is an early solution proposed by physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994, he proposed a "warp drive" that can achieve faster than light speeds not by accelerating the speed of a spacecraft, but by warping spacetime itself.</p>		
												<button type="button" class="collapsible">More Information</button>
												<div class="content">
													<p>Miguel Alcubierre's mathematical model describes a bubble of flat space surrounded by regions of extreme curvature—space expands behind the bubble and contracts ahead of it, propelling it forward. This is the Alcubierre metric:</p>
													<p>ds<sup>2</sup> = -dt<sup>2</sup> + [dx - v<sub>s</sub>(t)f(r<sub>s</sub>)dt]<sup>2</sup> + dy<sup>2</sup> + dz<sup>2</sup></p>
													<p>v<sub>s</sub>(t) is the velocity of the warp bubble, and f(r<sub>s</sub>) is a shaping function that bounds the distortion. The important thing to notice here is that the spaceship inside the bubble never exceeds the speed of light in its local frame; spacetime itself is in motion.</p>
													<p>But the model requires "exotic matter" with negative energy density—something that contradicts general relativity's established energy conditions. The energy density is about linearly proportional to −v<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>, or faster travel requires more negative energy. The Casimir effect and other phenomena suggest negative energy in bounded quantum scenarios, but producing and taming it at a useful scale remains purely theoretical.</p>
													<p>Inside the warp bubble, the ship would experience no acceleration or time dilation, drifting effortlessly in free fall along a geodesic. That's the charm from a relativistic standpoint. But there remain intimidating challenges: the theory requires enormous amounts of energy, generates potentially catastrophic tidal forces at the edge of the bubble, and may squeeze in-falling matter to killing densities.</p>
													<p>Alcubierre's work does not provide a buildable engine—but it broadens our thinking and makes us realize that faster-than-light travel is within the bounds of general relativity, if we can get around its physical constraints.</p>

												<h3 class="major">Einzel Lens</h3>
												<p>Electromagnetic Lening allows researchers to see into the nanoscale world, compared to regular optical lens used in regular microscopes which can only reach up to 2000x magnificaiton, electromagnetic microscopes can reach up to 10,000,000x magnification. Electromagnetic lensing uses electrons, after passing them through electric fields causes the electrons to change their trajectory, which results in the electrons converging to a focus point, allowing an image to be formed.</p>
												<button type="button" class="collapsible">More Information</button>
												<div class="content">
													<p>An Einzel lens is an electrostatic component that is commonly used to focus or collimate charged particle beams, such as electrons or ions, without altering their kinetic energy. It structurally consists of three coaxial cylindrical electrodes—two outer electrodes grounded and a middle electrode biased to a different potential (this is shown by the black rectangles, with each top and bottom pair being a coaxial cylindrical electrode). This arrangement creates a region of non-uniform electric fields that deflect the radial components of particle motion without changing their axial velocity. The electrostatic forces generated from the cylindrical symmetry and carefully controlled boundary conditions (can be seen by the blue E-field) act on particles passing through the lens, moving them toward or away from the central axis. The outcome is analogous to how optical lenses deflect light rays (the red dotted lines), and like their optical counterparts, Einzel lenses are susceptible to aberrations—such as spherical and chromatic distortions—which need to be compensated by precision engineering and voltage adjustment. Computationally, the lens action is governed by Laplace's equation in cylindrical coordinates, and simulations usually employ numerical methods to model potential distributions and particle trajectories.</p>

												<h3 class="major">Double Slit</h3>
												<p>A model of the double slit experiment, where the wave nature of light is demostrated accomplished by using a source of light but casting a light and dark fringes onto a screen, something that should be impossible if light itself was not a wave.</p>
												<button type="button" class="collapsible">More Information</button>
												<div class="content">
													<p>Young's double-slit experiment, conducted by Thomas Young in 1801, demonstrated the wave nature of light. It showed that when light passed through two small slits, it created an interference pattern on a screen behind them, characterized by alternating bright (constructive interference) and dark (destructive interference) fringes. The pattern, resulting from the superposition of light waves, provived strong evidence that light was a wave, and not a series of particles.</p>

												<h3 class="major">Three-Body Problem</h3>
												<p>A model of the three masses interact with each other through gravitational forces, unlike a two-body problem, where there are only two masses with gravity acting between them, a three-body problem does not have a general solution, only some special case solutions.</p>

												<h3 class="major">Lithium Ion Battery vs Solid State Battery</h3>
												<p>The major difference between a Lithium Ion battery, the widley used batteries that we use currently, and solid state batteries lies in the state of the electrolyte used in Li-ions and solid state batteries. In a Li-ion battery, the electrolyte inside of the battery is in a liquid form, whereas in a solid state battery, the electrolyte inside is solid; this difference allows the solid state battery to be able to charge much quicker compared to a Li-ion battery, along with the benefit of being safer.</p>
