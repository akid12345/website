												<h1>Digital-to-Analog Amplifier Combo</h1>
												<p>
													This project was focused on creating a power amplifier to connect my TV’s digital audio output 
													to the passive speaker system, while avoiding the more costly and ugly commercial solutions. 
													The main purpose of the power amplifier was to decode and amplify signals so they could drive 
													multiple speakers effectively. My design can also be broadened to be used for a home theater 
													setup, and other audio systems—such as public address setups, studio monitors, or custom 
													multimedia projects—where converting and amplifying signals is necessary to power speakers.

												<p>I tried searching online for a device that can decode Digital Audio output from TV through Optical Toslink into 5.1 analog signals, and amplify these 6 channels so that the signals are strong enough to drive the passive speakers; however, that kind of device did not exist. So instead I found a Digital to 5.1 CH converter in Amazon:</p>

												<p>I built my design based off the following datasheet:</p>
												<p>The principle behind an audio amplifier is to increase the input signal (power) so that it can drive a larger output load, which in this case is a speaker. Simplified down, an amplifier uses components like transistors or operational amplifiers to manipulate a large amoung of energy from a power supply from the inputs of a small signal</p>
												<p>The amplifier works by taking in an input voltage, and outputing it to one input of a differential amplifier. The output of said amplifier is then scaled to a version of the original signal, determined by the gain set my external resistors, and is used to drive a load that requires more current and volatge than what the initial input signal can provide alone.</p>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Nano/ADF_200kV_5MX_Au Sample Grid_0002.jpg" alt="" /></span>In this project, I patterned a silicon wafer using photolithography, applying a light-sensitive layer and exposing it to controlled light to define specific regions. I then used wet etching with acetone to remove unwanted material and carve precise features into the surface. To modify the wafer’s electrical properties, I doped targeted regions with gold and silica, creating areas with distinct conductivity. The resulting nanoscale structures were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning probe microscopy (SPM), allowing me to visualize surface details and doping patterns with high resolution. Finally, I fabricated a clean, precise “TMI” pattern on the wafer, ensuring smooth edges to maintain optimal electrical performance.</p>

														<p>The process to create a shape or film on top of a pure silicon wage begins with photolithography, where a light-sensitive photoresist is applied to the wafer and is exposed to ultralight in an enviornment deprived of blue light. The process determins which parts under the mask will remain.</p>
														<p>After the pattern on the silicon wafer is set, the next step is to etch, carving out the desired features onto the silicon wafer. In this project, I used a process called wet etching, in which the I used liquid chemicals (acetone) to dissolve exposed materials. This process is more cost effect and simple compared to dry etching, which involves plasma and gasses to remove the unwanted materials in a more percice manner.</p>
														<p>After etching the silicon plate, I added other materials (gold and silica) into the different areas to alter the electrical properties, creating regions that would conduct electricity differently.</p>

														<h3 class="major">Nanoscale Images of the Compounds for Doping</h3>
														<p>Doping introduces impurities to modify the electrical conductivity in specific regions, shaping the nanoscale architecture on the plate. The ions that are implanted into the silicon lattice create either a positive or negative region, which is the building block of transistors. At the nanoscale level, the doped regions can have different crystal structures or different depths of the regions, depending on the material and doping procedures. This makes having a high-resolution image extremely helpful. </p>
														<p>The two techniques that I used to image at the nanoscale are scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning probe microscopy (SPM). SEM uses a focused beam of electrons through electromagnetic fields to scan the wafer’s surface to produce high-resolution images that give information. SPM, on the other hand, uses a sharp nanoscale tip mounted on the end of a flexible cantilever to physically trace over the surface of the wafer, allowing it to build a 3D model of the surface topography.</p>

This becomes especially important when someone vulnerable—such as a child, elderly person, or individual with health issues—is trapped inside, where every second counts. My goal is to create a simple, reliable device that can be activated remotely, through a wireless signal, to quickly unlock the car without the need for specialized tools or external assistance.</p>

													<h3 class="major">Problem</h3>
													<p>In many older car models, there aren't any realistic ways to open your car doors if you locked your keys inside. These older models do not have apps that allow the car to be unlocked from someone's phones, so in many cases people will have a backup key. The problem with the backup key however is that the key itself will not be with the driver - it would be with a close friend or spouse, this means that there will be a margin of time before they would be able to enter their car without having to break their windows. This can be a extremely probalematic issue if there is someone who is unable to leave in the car, like a baby.</p>

													<p>The prototype functions by creating a rotating force, as seen with the twisting of the paper clip in the prototype. This causes the rod to be pushed outwards (or inwards) because the rod is hooked to a fixed segment on the rotating disk in the middle. Once the rod is pushed outwards, it can then be used to push the lock on the inside of the car door, allowing it to be opened.</p>

												<h3 class="major">Warp Drive</h3>
												<p>The theory behind Faster-than-Light travel in Sci-Fi novels is derived from Einstein's General Relativity. The model above is an early solution proposed by physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994. He gave the idea of a "warp drive" that can achieve faster-than-light speeds through distorting spacetime, rather than the acceleration of the spacecraft. In his model, he describes a bubble of flat space surrounded by regions of extreme curvature, space expanding behind the bubble and contracting in front of it, which allows the space to push the bubble forwards at FTL speeds.</p>		
												<button type="button" class="collapsible">More Information</button>
												<div class="content">
													<p>Miguel Alcubierre's mathematical model describes a bubble of flat space surrounded by regions of extreme curvature—space expands behind the bubble and contracts ahead of it, propelling it forward. This is the Alcubierre metric:</p>
													<p>ds<sup>2</sup> = -dt<sup>2</sup> + [dx - v<sub>s</sub>(t)f(r<sub>s</sub>)dt]<sup>2</sup> + dy<sup>2</sup> + dz<sup>2</sup></p>
													<p>v<sub>s</sub>(t) is the velocity of the warp bubble, and f(r<sub>s</sub>) is a shaping function that bounds the distortion. The important thing to notice here is that the spaceship inside the bubble never exceeds the speed of light in its local frame; spacetime itself is in motion.</p>
													<p>But the model requires "exotic matter" with negative energy density—something that contradicts general relativity's established energy conditions. The energy density is about linearly proportional to −v<sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup>, or faster travel requires more negative energy. The Casimir effect and other phenomena suggest negative energy in bounded quantum scenarios, but producing and taming it at a useful scale remains purely theoretical.</p>
													<p>Inside the warp bubble, the ship would experience no acceleration or time dilation, drifting effortlessly in free fall along a geodesic. That's the charm from a relativistic standpoint. But there remain intimidating challenges: the theory requires enormous amounts of energy, generates potentially catastrophic tidal forces at the edge of the bubble, and may squeeze in-falling matter to killing densities.</p>
													<p>Alcubierre's work does not provide a buildable engine—but it broadens our thinking and makes us realize that faster-than-light travel is within the bounds of general relativity, if we can get around its physical constraints.</p>

												<h3 class="major">Einzel Lens</h3>
												<p>Einzel lenses are a type of electromagnetic lensmadeup of three aligned electrodes, with the middle electrode being held at a different electric potential than the two electrodes on the ends of the lens. This difference in electric potential creates an electric field that causes electrons passing through the lens to have their trajectory changed, resulting in the electrons focusing onto one point and creating an image. Electromagnetic lenses, like Einzel lenses, allow researchers to see into the nanoscale, far smaller than what a regular optical lens can achieve.</p>
												<button type="button" class="collapsible">More Information</button>
												<div class="content">
													<p>An Einzel lens is an electrostatic component that is commonly used to focus or collimate charged particle beams, such as electrons or ions, without altering their kinetic energy. It structurally consists of three coaxial cylindrical electrodes—two outer electrodes grounded and a middle electrode biased to a different potential (this is shown by the black rectangles, with each top and bottom pair being a coaxial cylindrical electrode). This arrangement creates a region of non-uniform electric fields that deflect the radial components of particle motion without changing their axial velocity. The electrostatic forces generated from the cylindrical symmetry and carefully controlled boundary conditions (can be seen by the blue E-field) act on particles passing through the lens, moving them toward or away from the central axis. The outcome is analogous to how optical lenses deflect light rays (the red dotted lines), and like their optical counterparts, Einzel lenses are susceptible to aberrations—such as spherical and chromatic distortions—which need to be compensated by precision engineering and voltage adjustment. Computationally, the lens action is governed by Laplace's equation in cylindrical coordinates, and simulations usually employ numerical methods to model potential distributions and particle trajectories.</p>

												<div class="content">
													<p>Young's double-slit experiment, conducted in 1801, demonstrated the wave nature of light by allowing the light to pass through two adjacent small slits onto a screen, resulting in an interference pattern of light and dark fringes due to the superposition of the light waves. This provived strong evidence that light was a wave, and not a series of particles.</p>

												<p>The major difference between a Lithium Ion battery, the widley used batteries that we use currently, and solid state batteries lies in the state of the electrolyte used in Li-ions and solid state batteries. In a Li-ion battery, the electrolyte inside of the battery is in a liquid form, whereas in a solid state battery, the electrolyte inside is solid; this difference allows the solid state battery to be able to charge much quicker compared to a Li-ion battery, along with the benefit of being safer.</p>
